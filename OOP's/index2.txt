Correct explanation (important)

self represents the current object

self.name means “name that belongs to this specific object”

Without self, the variable exists only inside the function, not inside the object

def __init__(self, name):
    name = name   # local variable, destroyed after function ends
print(s1.name)

❌ Error, because the object never stored name.

🔹 One-line rule (memorize this)

If you want data to live inside an object, you must attach it to self.
